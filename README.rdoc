== RGeo::GeoJSON

RGeo::GeoJSON is an optional module for {RGeo}[http://github.com/dazuma/rgeo]
that provides GeoJSON encoding and decoding services.

=== Summary

\RGeo is a key component for writing location-aware applications in the
Ruby programming language. At its core is an implementation of the
industry standard OGC Simple Features Specification, which provides data
representations of geometric objects such as points, lines, and polygons,
along with a set of geometric analysis operations. See the README for the
"rgeo" gem for more information.

RGeo::GeoJSON is an optional \RGeo add-on module that provides GeoJSON
encoding and decoding services. GeoJSON is an emerging standard format
used by many web services that need to communicate geospatial data. See
http://www.geojson.org for more information.

Example:

 require 'rgeo/geo_json'
 
 str1 = '{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1,2]}'
 geom = RGeo::GeoJSON.decode(str1, :json_parser => :json)
 geom.as_text              # => "POINT(1.0 2.0)"
 
 str2 = '{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.5,4.0]},"properties":{"color":"red"}}'
 feature = RGeo::GeoJSON.decode(str2, :json_parser => :json)
 feature['color']          # => 'red'
 feature.geometry.as_text  # => "POINT(2.5 4.0)"
 
 hash = RGeo::GeoJSON.encode(feature)
 hash.to_json == str2      # => true

=== Installation

RGeo::GeoJSON has the following requirements:

* Ruby 1.8.7 or later. Ruby 1.9.2 or later preferred.
* rgeo 0.3.13 or later.
* If you are using Ruby 1.8, you should install the "json" gem to support
  parsing JSON strings. Ruby 1.9 has JSON support in its standard library
  and does not require the gem.

Install RGeo::GeoJSON as a gem:

 gem install rgeo
 gem install rgeo-geojson

See the README for the "rgeo" gem, a required dependency, for further
installation information.

=== To-do list

* Add support for the "bbox" and "crs" elements.
