`rgeo-geojson` is an extension to [RGeo](https://github.com/rgeo/rgeo)
that provides GeoJSON encoding and decoding.

## Summary

RGeo is a key component for writing location-aware applications in the Ruby
programming language. At its core is an implementation of the industry
standard OGC Simple Features Specification, which provides data
representations of geometric objects such as points, lines, and polygons,
along with a set of geometric analysis operations. See the README for the
"rgeo" gem for more information.

`RGeo::GeoJSON` is an optional RGeo module that provides GeoJSON encoding
and decoding. [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org) is a JSON format used for
geographic data structures.

Example:

```ruby
require 'rgeo/geo_json'

str1 = '{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1,2]}'
geom = RGeo::GeoJSON.decode(str1)
geom.as_text              # => "POINT (1.0 2.0)"

str2 = '{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.5,4.0]},"properties":{"color":"red"}}'
feature = RGeo::GeoJSON.decode(str2)
feature['color']          # => 'red'
feature.geometry.as_text  # => "POINT (2.5 4.0)"

hash = RGeo::GeoJSON.encode(feature)
hash.to_json == str2      # => true
```

## Install

`RGeo::GeoJSON` requires:

* Ruby 2.1.0 or later
* rgeo 1.0.0 or later

Include in your bundle:

```ruby
gem 'rgeo-geojson'
```

Install `rgeo-geojson` as a gem:

```sh
gem install rgeo-geojson
```

See the README for the `rgeo` gem, a required dependency, for further installation information.
